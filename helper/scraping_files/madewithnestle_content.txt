Smart Strategies to Lose Weight, One Meal at a TimeThursday, July 06, 2017ShareTweetEmailPinPrintBy Julie DesGroseilliers, Registered DietitianWhen it comes to losing weight, there’s no miracle recipe or magic food that melts fat. So, to reach and maintain a healthy weight, you have to change your daily habits…for life! It takes a little effort, time, and perseverance. Simply by moving a little more every day and by trying some of the meal ideas below, you may not only slim your waistline, but you’ll improve your health and daily vitality.Ideas to lighten up your mealsReplace the ground beef in your spaghetti sauce with lentils. It’s a great trick to reduce fat content and calories, while increasing fibre, a natural appetite suppressant.On pizza and for other dishes using melted cheese, mix full-fat cheese with low-fat cheese, or mix it with firm shredded tofu instead. No one will be able to tell the difference! And to make the meal even more low-fat and nutritious, double the quantity of vegetables.Substitute pasta by using spaghetti squash, or “spiralize” vegetables such as zucchini or beets. A delicious and refreshing alternative! Do you like cream sauces, such as Alfredo pasta sauce? Try a 5% cream blend for cooking, or use soy plant-based cooking cream for a lower fat version.Replace quiches with omelettes and frittatas. Without crusts, these dishes contain less fat. Containing only 70 calories each, eggs are an excellent weight-loss ally. Two eggs make up a portion. Think about adding them to your salad meals. Note that a healthy adult can have seven eggs weekly.Add edamame beans to your menu more often. Rich in fibre and protein, they prolong the feeling of fullness, reducing cravings. Boil these frozen beans for four to five minutes and they are ready to be added to your salad meals, Asian dishes, soups, and pasta dishes.Nutritious snacksSince fruits and vegetables, as well as milk and milk-substitutes, are among the foods most under-consumed by Canadians,[1]make them a priority at snack-time.Containing twice as much protein as traditional yogurt, 0 or 2% fat Greek yogurt is a perfect snack. Ideally, choose the plain option and flavour it to taste with fruit and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup.Instead of a granola bar, muffin or other commercially prepared bakery product, choose ripe fresh fruit and a few nuts. A much more nourishing and filling combo.Low in calories, try raw vegetables more often. And for a dip, go with plain Greek yogurt with a little pesto.Snack on oven-baked edamame. A great alternative to chips!Need a more filling snack? Go for a hard-boiled egg and some raw vegetables, or make a homemade smoothie with milk or a soy beverage, fresh fruit, and Greek yogurt.No matter what or when you eat, it is important to respect your hunger signals and your satiety. Eat only when your body needs to fuel up. And remember that fruits and vegetables should be the focus of your meals. They are very nutritious, so they should make up half of your plate. Meat should be the side dish to your vegetables, not the other way around!This article has been sponsored by BOOST®, but all comments and opinions are my own.Julie DesGroseilliersRegistered DietitianRegistered Dietitian and nutritionist Julie DesGroseilliers holds a Bachelor of Nutrition and a Minor in Physical Activity Science from the Université de Montréal.

Simply by moving a little more every day and by trying some of the meal ideas below, you may not only slim your waistline, but you’ll improve your health and daily vitality.

Replace the ground beef in your spaghetti sauce with lentils. It’s a great trick to reduce fat content and calories, while increasing fibre, a natural appetite suppressant.

On pizza and for other dishes using melted cheese, mix full-fat cheese with low-fat cheese, or mix it with firm shredded tofu instead. No one will be able to tell the difference! And to make the meal even more low-fat and nutritious, double the quantity of vegetables.

Substitute pasta by using spaghetti squash, or “spiralize” vegetables such as zucchini or beets. A delicious and refreshing alternative! Do you like cream sauces, such as Alfredo pasta sauce? Try a 5% cream blend for cooking, or use soy plant-based cooking cream for a lower fat version.

Replace quiches with omelettes and frittatas. Without crusts, these dishes contain less fat. Containing only 70 calories each, eggs are an excellent weight-loss ally. Two eggs make up a portion. Think about adding them to your salad meals. Note that a healthy adult can have seven eggs weekly.

Add edamame beans to your menu more often. Rich in fibre and protein, they prolong the feeling of fullness, reducing cravings. Boil these frozen beans for four to five minutes and they are ready to be added to your salad meals, Asian dishes, soups, and pasta dishes.

Since fruits and vegetables, as well as milk and milk-substitutes, are among the foods most under-consumed by Canadians,[1]make them a priority at snack-time.

Containing twice as much protein as traditional yogurt, 0 or 2% fat Greek yogurt is a perfect snack. Ideally, choose the plain option and flavour it to taste with fruit and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup.

Instead of a granola bar, muffin or other commercially prepared bakery product, choose ripe fresh fruit and a few nuts. A much more nourishing and filling combo.

Low in calories, try raw vegetables more often. And for a dip, go with plain Greek yogurt with a little pesto.

Snack on oven-baked edamame. A great alternative to chips!

Need a more filling snack? Go for a hard-boiled egg and some raw vegetables, or make a homemade smoothie with milk or a soy beverage, fresh fruit, and Greek yogurt.

No matter what or when you eat, it is important to respect your hunger signals and your satiety. Eat only when your body needs to fuel up. And remember that fruits and vegetables should be the focus of your meals. They are very nutritious, so they should make up half of your plate. Meat should be the side dish to your vegetables, not the other way around!

What does this Privacy Notice apply to?This Privacy Notice applies to personal information that we collect from or about our consumers through the methods described in this section.This Privacy Notice does NOT apply to information collected by our affiliate companies, or joint venture partners.Please note we may combine personal information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website) with personal information that we collect via another method (e.g., an offline event). We do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and with more customization.Nestlé websitesThis refers to any consumer-directed websites operated by Nestlé, including websites that we operate under our own domains/URLs and websites that we run on third party social networks such as Facebook (e.g. Facebook fan page).Nestlé mobile sites/applicationsThis refers to any consumer-directed mobile sites or applications operated by Nestlé, including our smartphone apps (e.g., iPhone apps).Nestlé electronic messaging programsThis refers to any consumer-directed electronic messaging programs operated by Nestlé including e-mail, text and other electronic messages. These programs might be advertised on one of our websites or applications or in a print ad.Offline registration cardsThis refers to printed registration and similar cards that we may collect from consumers via, for example, postal mail, in-store demos, contests and other promotions or other offline events.Call centersThis refers to personal information that we may collect from consumers through our call centres, for example if you call us with a question or comment or to sign up for marketing communications over the phone.Advertising interactions.Interactions with our advertisements (e.g., if you interact with on one of our ads on a third party website, we may receive information about that interaction).Data We create.In the course of our interactions with you, we may create Personal Data about you (e.g. records of your purchases from our websites).Data from other sourcesThis refers to personal information we may obtain about you from other sources. For example, we may hire a third party data aggregator to provide us additional information about our existing consumers (this is known as “data appending”). We may also receive information from third party co-sponsors who we may occasionally partner with to run special contests or other promotions. We may also receive information about consumers when we acquire other companies, from public sources, from third party social networks and through market research (if feedback is not provided on an anonymous basis).Telemetry DataWe may automatically collect data from Nestlé commercial coffee machines that are leased to enterprises. This information may include the machine Serial Number, machine alerts or errors, ingredient stock levels, and the number and type of coffees prepared by users, with the respective date and time. This information is associated with the enterprise customer but is not linked to any individual user of the machine. We use this information to determine usage trends and stock levels.2. What information do we collect?Depending on how you interact with us (online, offline, over the phone, etc.), we may collect from you various types of information (personal and aggregate), as described in this section.Personal information (as used in this Privacy Notice) refers to such types of information that can be used to personally identify you, whether alone or in combination with other available information, whereas aggregate information does not allow for such identification.In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine/link one type of information with another type of information (e.g., personal contact information with account login and/or demographic information) and store them together in our records. In cases, where personal and aggregate information are combined, such information will always be considered as personal information. We strive to limit the amount of personal information we collect and store to that which is reasonably necessary to provide you the relevant services. We generally store your personal information for as long as your account is active with us or as needed to provide you the relevant services. We may store your personal information for a longer period of time to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for records management purposes.Personal contact informationThis includes any information that would allow us to personally contact you, such as your name, home or mailing address, phone number (home, cell, etc.), or email address. In some cases, this could include personal information that you give us about someone else (for example, if you provide a friend’s email address for a tell-a-friend program). We typically collect personal contact information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up, website and social community features, online purchases, consumer service inquiries, contests and other promotions, and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, your personal contact information may be stored under your account profile.Account login informationThis refers to any information that is required for you to establish a unique account with us or for us to give you access to your specific account profile. Examples may include your login ID/email address, screen name, password, and/or security question and answer. We only collect unique login information for those activities that require an account, such as general website registration, newsletter sign-up, and website and social community features. Your login information, especially your password, should be kept confidential and never shared with anyone else. To change your login email address or password, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if available), use the “forgot password” feature of our site (if available), or contact Consumer Services.Demographic informationThis includes any information that describes your demographic or psychographic characteristics. Examples may include your date of birth, age or age range, gender, geographic location (e.g., zip code, city and state, mobile location), favourite products, hobbies and interests, and household or lifestyle information.

It may include information about your children’s genders, feeding styles, birthdates, or expected due dates. It may include information about work status or professional credentials. It may also include information about your pets and pet preferences. We may collect demographic information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up, website and social community registration, contests and other promotions, and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, you may be allowed to modify certain demographic information stored under your account. To do so, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if available) or contact Consumer Services. For demographic information stored under your profile on a third party social network (e.g., Facebook), see the separate paragraph on “Social network information.” below.Health care practitioner informationIf you are a health care practitioner, our sales representatives may collect information about you and your practice such as your name, language preference, profession, medical opinions, specialty, address, phone number and email address. We may collect this information directly from you or your colleagues, or from public sources such as business directories. We use this information to better understand your needs and preferences, personalize our interactions with you, and send business communications to you in order to keep you informed about the latest information about our products that may be of interest to you and/or your patients.Technical computer informationThis includes any information about the computer system or other technological device that you may be using to access one of our websites or applications. We typically collect this information through automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons. Examples of technical computer information may include your computer’s IP address, operating system type, and web browser type. If you access a Nestlé website or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected information may also include your phone’s unique device ID, geo-location and other similar mobile device data.Website usage informationThis includes information about how you use and navigate our websites and applications, including which links you click on, which pages or content you view and for how long, and other similar information and statistics about your interactions with a Nestlé website or application (e.g., date and time of visit, which site you came from, favourite recipes and site activities, high game scores, etc.). This information is captured using automated tracking technologies such as browser cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons, and may also be collected through the use of third party tracking services (such as Google Analytics) that collect data in aggregate (such as number of visits to a particular page, or the amount of time spent on a web site). We may also use these technologies, such as web beacons, to capture information about how users respond to certain email campaigns (e.g., time the email is opened, where user links to from the email, etc.). Please see Question 8 (“Tracking technologies – How and why do we use them?”).Please note that “flash” cookies are different from "browser” cookies because of the way in which flash cookies capture and store data. Your browser’s cookie management tools will not remove flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. We use tracking tools to serve you with interest-based advertising and to better understand your behaviours and browsing activities. We might permit third parties to gather information passively on our websites, including for behavioral advertising purposes. We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. You can control tracking tools. In particular, your browser gives you the ability to delete or reject browser cookies. If you block cookies, certain features on our website may not work. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so note that our systems may not recognize Do Not Track headers or signals from some or all browsers. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this Privacy Notice will stop.Consumer feedbackThis includes information that you voluntarily share with us about your experience in using our products and services, including our websites and applications. Examples may include unsolicited comments and suggestions, testimonials, or other questions or feedback related to our products. We typically collect this information in the form of consumer surveys, consumer panels, contact forms, “Ask the Expert” forms, and email correspondence.Consumer-generated contentThis refers to any content that you create and then share with us (and perhaps others) by uploading it to one of our websites or applications, including one of our Facebook sites. Examples may include photos, videos, personal stories, or other similar media or content. We may collect and publish consumer-generated content in connection with a variety of activities, including contests and other promotions, website community features, consumer engagement, and third party social networking.Social network informationThis refers to any information that you share publicly on a third-party social network or is part of your profile on a third party social network (such as Facebook) and that you allow the third party social network to share with us. Examples include your basic account information (e.g. name, email address, gender, birthday, current city, profile picture, user ID, list of friends, etc.) and any other additional information or activities that you permit the third party social network to share with third party application developers. For example, we may receive your social network profile information (or parts of it) every time you download or interact with a Nestlé web application on a social network such as Facebook or every time you use a social networking feature that is integrated within a Nestlé website (such as Facebook Connect). To learn more about how your information from a third party social network may be obtained by us (or other third party application developers), please visit the website of the relevant social network. You further acknowledge that we may use your personal information to match information with a social network for advertising purposes (see “Marketing communications” under Question 3 of this Privacy Notice).Payment informationThis includes any information that you use to make a purchase, such as your credit card details (cardholder name, card number, expiration date, etc.) or other forms of payment (if such are made available). This also includes the billing name and address associated with your form of payment. If you create an account with us when making a purchase, your payment information may be stored under your account profile. To review or edit this information, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if one is available) or contact the consumer service department listed at the relevant store website.Calls to Consumer Engagement Services.Communications with a call centre can be recorded or listened into, in accordance with applicable laws, for local operational needs (e.g. for quality or training purposes) and verification purposes. Payment card details are not recorded. Where required by law, you will be informed about such recording at the beginning of your call.Sensitive Personal Data.We process certain sensitive personal data that you provide to us for marketing purposes with your prior express consent. If we process your sensitive personal data for other purposes, we rely on the following legal bases: (i) detection and prevention of crime (including the prevention of fraud); and (ii) compliance with applicable law.CCTV Information. Closed circuit video surveillance cameras (“CCTV”) may be installed at some of our retail locations to monitor building security and to ensure the health and safety of our staff and customers, and, where applicable, to assist in crime prevention, detection, and law enforcement investigation. We ensure that the ways in which any personal information is collected via our CCTV systems are compliant with all applicable privacy protection laws and are limited only to the extent that is necessary to ensure the safety of our staff and customers. If you have further questions pertaining to our collection of CCTV information,please contact our Chief Privacy Officer atConsumer.care@ca.nestle.com.DNA Data.Nestlé collects and analyzes your genetic information, including DNA information, when you choose to share it with us. You must share yourwww.23andMe.comor ANCESTRY.COM data file with Nestlé to take advantage of this service.Other information (depending on context)This refers to any other information that we might need to collect for a specific Nestlé form, feature, or other service that you use or request. What this information includes will vary depending on the method of collection and the specific purpose(s) for which the information is being collected. Please see Question 3 (“How do we use your information?”) for more specific examples.3. How do we use your personal information?The following paragraphs describe the various purposes and features for which we might collect and use your personal information, and the different types of information that might be collected from you through the different methods described in Question 1 above. Please note that not all of the uses below will be relevant to every consumer.Account maintenanceWe may use your personal information to maintain your accounts with us, including administering any consumer loyalty, rewards or membership programs that are associated with your account. This typically involves the use of personal information that was originally collected to set up your account (e.g., personal contact information, payment information, account login information, demographic information, etc.).Consumer serviceWe may collect and use your personal information to provide you consumer service, including responses to your inquiries. This typically requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information (such as your name or email address) and information regarding the reason for your inquiry (e.g., order status, technical issue, product question/complaint, general question, etc.). Consumer service may be provided through various forms of communication, including email correspondence, call centre support, social communities and live online chat features.Product improvement and customizationWe may collect and use your personal information so we can constantly improve our products, tailor them to your needs, and come up with new product ideas. This mostly involves the collection and use of demographic information and consumer feedback.Consumer engagementWe may collect and use your personal information to get you more actively engaged with our products and services (including our websites and applications), thereby increasing overall brand engagement and awareness. This mostly involves the collection, use, and publication of consumer-generated content, profile information, promotional activity, engagement with our websites & digital content.Contests and other promotionsWe may collect and use your personal information to administer a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. These events typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (for prize fulfilment), demographic information (for eligibility determination), and, in some instances, consumer-generated content. Some of our promotions may be run on third party social networks such as Facebook (for example, on our Facebook fan pages). To comply with legal requirements, we may publish or share a limited amount of personal information (such as name and city of residence) about the winners of a particular promotion. For more information about our contests and other promotions, please see the official rules or details posted with each promotion.Marketing communicationsWe may collect and use your personal information to send you marketing communications, such as email communications, SMS text messages, and postal mailings. Please note that if you choose to receive SMS text messages, your mobile service provider’s fees for messaging will apply. We may also show you marketing communications on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member, by matching activities or information collected on our websites with those collected on third party sites (“Targeted Advertising”). These marketing communications will keep you up-to-date on the latest news, events, special offers, and promotions from our brands of interest to you. On occasion, these communications may also introduce you to other Nestlé brands and inform you about offers and promotions from other third party companies. Sending you marketing communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and demographic information. In some instances (such as for mobile apps and text messaging programs), this could involve the use of your precise geo-location, which may allow us to send you location-based offers and promotions. You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email communications or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. If you have an account with us, you may be given the option to change your communication preferences under the relevant edit-account section of our site (if available) or by contactingConsumer Services. Changing these preferences would also remove you from our lists for future Targeted Advertising. You may also visit social media sites where you are a member to explore opt out options they may provide for Targeted Advertising. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive administrative communications from us, such as order confirmations, notifications about your account activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important announcements. You will also still see generic ads on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member.Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third party company, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third party (not Nestlé) to opt-out from such communications. This process may be outlined in the third party’s privacy policy.Third party social networkingWe may collect and use your personal information when you interact with third party social networking features such as “Facebook Connect” or “Facebook Like”. These features may be integrated in our sites or applications for the purposes of running contests, allowing you to share content with friends, or other stated purposes. If you use these features, we may have the ability to obtain certain information about you from your social networking profile (see “Social network information” under Question 2 of this Privacy Notice). You can learn more about how these features work, and the profile data we may obtain about you, by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network.Website improvement and personalizationWe may collect and use your information to improve and personalize your experience on our websites and applications, to analyze your preferences and habits, to anticipate your needs based on our analysis of your profile, to improve and personalize your experience on our websites and apps, to ensure that content from our website/apps is optimized for you and for your computer or device and to participate in interactive features. This is typically done through automated tracking technologies (please also see Question 8) that collect and remember certain account login information, technical information, and/or previous website usage information. For example, we might remember your login ID/email address or screen name so you can quickly login the next time you visit our site or so you can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping cart. Based on this type of information, we may also show you specific Nestlé content or promotions that are tailored to your interests.Website community featuresWe may collect and use your personal information to give you access to website community features, including features that may allow you to upload and share recipes, pictures, videos, artwork, or other messages or content. This typically involves the collection, use, and (in some instances) public display of certain personal contact information, account login information, demographic information, and/or consumer-generated content. Because these features are “communal” in nature, information or content that you post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use caution when using these features or uploading content to a Nestlé site. For some community features, we may give you the ability to control whether some parts of your profile can be seen by others. To access these settings, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if one is available) and access your community profile. For website community features that have social networking integration (such as “Facebook Connect”), see separate paragraph on “Third party social networking”.Website viral features (e.g. tell-a-friend)We may request and use your personal information so you can use website viral features, such as our tell-a-friend features. These features allow you to easily share certain news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (such as names and email addresses) so that the selected one-time message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In most cases, we do not retain the information provided. In some cases (for example, as part of a refer-a-friend program), we may store the information so we can track and reward consumers for their successful referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features administered by third party social networks (such as Facebook’s “Share” and “Like” features), please refer to the website of the relevant social network for additional information.Order fulfilmentWe may collect and use your personal information to process and ship your orders, to inform you about the status of your orders, correct addresses and conduct identity verification and other fraud-detection activities. This could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or other information related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the on-going storage of your payment information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases.Please note that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases on those sites.Other general purposes (e.g., website security, internal research)We may collect and use your information for other general business purposes, such as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of our websites and applications, to conduct internal marketing and demographic studies (including using anonymized personal information in a statistical or aggregated form for research and marketing purposes) and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These activities mostly require the collection and use of certain demographic information, technical computer information, website usage information, and consumer feedback.Suppliers/CustomersWe collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for the purposes of assessing and ensuring the credit worthiness of suppliers and customers and for the purpose of determining the continuing viability of such suppliers and customers when entering into or renewing contracts for supply of products to and from such suppliers or customers.4. How do we protect your personal information?We use a variety of standard methods (described below) to help keep consumer information confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply to information you choose to share in public areas such as our website and social community features or other social areas.Secure operating environmentsWe store your information in secure operating environments that are protected from the public and that we only allow authorized Nestlé employees and agents/contractors to access on a need-to-know basis. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information; however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.Also, as part of our standard procedures, your personal information may be stored and processed in jurisdictions outside of your province of residence or outside the country such as the United State and Switzerland. In such cases, we continue to use generally accepted industry standards and secure operating environments to protect your information. However, regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions may be able to gain access to your information pursuant to the laws of those jurisdictions.Encryption for payment infoWe use industry-standard encryption to provide greater protection for sensitive financial information, such as credit card information, sent to us over the web. For example, encryption is used when you make payments through our online stores. Please note, however, that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases.Prior authentication for account accessWe require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g., login ID/email address, password) before they can access or make changes to their account information. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account.Measures we expect you to takeIt is important for you to also play a role in keeping your information safe and secure.

These marketing communications will keep you up-to-date on the latest news, events, special offers, and promotions from our brands of interest to you. On occasion, these communications may also introduce you to other Nestlé brands and inform you about offers and promotions from other third party companies. Sending you marketing communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and demographic information. In some instances (such as for mobile apps and text messaging programs), this could involve the use of your precise geo-location, which may allow us to send you location-based offers and promotions. You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email communications or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. If you have an account with us, you may be given the option to change your communication preferences under the relevant edit-account section of our site (if available) or by contactingConsumer Services. Changing these preferences would also remove you from our lists for future Targeted Advertising. You may also visit social media sites where you are a member to explore opt out options they may provide for Targeted Advertising. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive administrative communications from us, such as order confirmations, notifications about your account activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important announcements. You will also still see generic ads on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member.Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third party company, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third party (not Nestlé) to opt-out from such communications. This process may be outlined in the third party’s privacy policy.Third party social networkingWe may collect and use your personal information when you interact with third party social networking features such as “Facebook Connect” or “Facebook Like”. These features may be integrated in our sites or applications for the purposes of running contests, allowing you to share content with friends, or other stated purposes. If you use these features, we may have the ability to obtain certain information about you from your social networking profile (see “Social network information” under Question 2 of this Privacy Notice). You can learn more about how these features work, and the profile data we may obtain about you, by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network.Website improvement and personalizationWe may collect and use your information to improve and personalize your experience on our websites and applications, to analyze your preferences and habits, to anticipate your needs based on our analysis of your profile, to improve and personalize your experience on our websites and apps, to ensure that content from our website/apps is optimized for you and for your computer or device and to participate in interactive features. This is typically done through automated tracking technologies (please also see Question 8) that collect and remember certain account login information, technical information, and/or previous website usage information. For example, we might remember your login ID/email address or screen name so you can quickly login the next time you visit our site or so you can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping cart. Based on this type of information, we may also show you specific Nestlé content or promotions that are tailored to your interests.Website community featuresWe may collect and use your personal information to give you access to website community features, including features that may allow you to upload and share recipes, pictures, videos, artwork, or other messages or content. This typically involves the collection, use, and (in some instances) public display of certain personal contact information, account login information, demographic information, and/or consumer-generated content. Because these features are “communal” in nature, information or content that you post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use caution when using these features or uploading content to a Nestlé site. For some community features, we may give you the ability to control whether some parts of your profile can be seen by others. To access these settings, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if one is available) and access your community profile. For website community features that have social networking integration (such as “Facebook Connect”), see separate paragraph on “Third party social networking”.Website viral features (e.g. tell-a-friend)We may request and use your personal information so you can use website viral features, such as our tell-a-friend features. These features allow you to easily share certain news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (such as names and email addresses) so that the selected one-time message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In most cases, we do not retain the information provided. In some cases (for example, as part of a refer-a-friend program), we may store the information so we can track and reward consumers for their successful referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features administered by third party social networks (such as Facebook’s “Share” and “Like” features), please refer to the website of the relevant social network for additional information.Order fulfilmentWe may collect and use your personal information to process and ship your orders, to inform you about the status of your orders, correct addresses and conduct identity verification and other fraud-detection activities. This could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or other information related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the on-going storage of your payment information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases.Please note that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases on those sites.Other general purposes (e.g., website security, internal research)We may collect and use your information for other general business purposes, such as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of our websites and applications, to conduct internal marketing and demographic studies (including using anonymized personal information in a statistical or aggregated form for research and marketing purposes) and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These activities mostly require the collection and use of certain demographic information, technical computer information, website usage information, and consumer feedback.Suppliers/CustomersWe collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for the purposes of assessing and ensuring the credit worthiness of suppliers and customers and for the purpose of determining the continuing viability of such suppliers and customers when entering into or renewing contracts for supply of products to and from such suppliers or customers.4. How do we protect your personal information?We use a variety of standard methods (described below) to help keep consumer information confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply to information you choose to share in public areas such as our website and social community features or other social areas.Secure operating environmentsWe store your information in secure operating environments that are protected from the public and that we only allow authorized Nestlé employees and agents/contractors to access on a need-to-know basis. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information; however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.Also, as part of our standard procedures, your personal information may be stored and processed in jurisdictions outside of your province of residence or outside the country such as the United State and Switzerland. In such cases, we continue to use generally accepted industry standards and secure operating environments to protect your information. However, regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions may be able to gain access to your information pursuant to the laws of those jurisdictions.Encryption for payment infoWe use industry-standard encryption to provide greater protection for sensitive financial information, such as credit card information, sent to us over the web. For example, encryption is used when you make payments through our online stores. Please note, however, that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases.Prior authentication for account accessWe require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g., login ID/email address, password) before they can access or make changes to their account information. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account.Measures we expect you to takeIt is important for you to also play a role in keeping your information safe and secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account password that is hard for others to guess and never reveal your password to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email address or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer. You should also make use of any privacy settings or controls we may provide you in our website community areas.5. What happens if you refuse to provide your personal information?If you choose not to submit any personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities and personalized features and you may limit the services and special offers we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you will not be able to receive any of our newsletters or otherwise register on our websites or use our applications. If you refuse to provide your credit card number, you will not be able to purchase products at a Nestlé online store. However, to simply browse our websites and learn more about our products, you do not need to give us any personal information.6. Who do we disclose your personal information to and why?Nestlé will not share your personal information with any third party that intends to use it for direct marketing purposes unless we have specifically informed you and you have given us specific permission to do this. Employees of Nestlé may have access to your personal information in the course of providing our services to you. Employee access to personal information will be restricted to those employees who have a legitimate need to know such information for the performance of their employment duties at Nestlé.We may share your personal information with our subsidiary companies, companies in which Nestlé S.A. has control through either direct or indirect ownership (collectively “Nestlé Group”). Nestlé may also share your personal information with third parties, but only in the following circumstances:Service Providers, Agents and ContractorsWe may use third parties, like service providers, agents or contractors to provide support for the internal operations of our websites and applications and to assist us with administering our websites and applications or the various functions, programs and promotions available to you. Some of these third parties may be located outside the country where you accessed this website. These third parties and its employees may come into contact with your personal information in the course of providing their services to us. Any such third party must at all times provide the same levels of security for your personal information as Nestlé and, where required, are bound by a legal agreement to keep your personal information private, secure and to process it only on the specific instructions of Nestlé.

If your personal information is being collected by (or is shared with) a company other than Nestlé as part of such promotion, we will let you know this at the time your personal information is collected. Periodically, we may run a promotion on our website or application that features the products or services of another company and will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive information directly from that third party company. When doing any promotion involving another company, we may provide a separate link to that company's privacy policy and we encourage you to read it before you share any personal information, as we cannot guarantee they adhere to the same privacy practices. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a company other than ours, you can always choose not to opt in or participate in these events at the time the personal information is collected/requested.Legal and Business TransfersWe may also disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes, to respond to any claims, enforce the terms of any agreement or the terms of our website, or to protect the safety, property, privacy or rights of Nestlé, its customers, or the public.In the event of a merger or acquisition of all or part of Nestlé by another company, or in the event that Nestlé were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the Nestlé business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by that Nestlé business, which could include personal information. Similarly, personal information may be transferred as part of a corporate reorganization, insolvency proceeding, or other similar event, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.Health Care PractitionerWhen you register for an account on one of our websites based upon receiving an invitation to register from your practitioner, we will share your information, including your Genetic Data file, with your practitioner for the purposes of allowing them to make medical recommendations to you based on your Genetic Data.Aggregate InformationWe may share aggregated demographic or survey information with third parties, but this information is in anonymous form and does not contain any personal information.

1. What does this Privacy Notice apply to?

This Privacy Notice applies to personal information that we collect from or about our consumers through the methods described in this section.

This Privacy Notice does NOT apply to information collected by our affiliate companies, or joint venture partners.

Please note we may combine personal information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website) with personal information that we collect via another method (e.g., an offline event). We do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and with more customization.

This refers to any consumer-directed websites operated by Nestlé, including websites that we operate under our own domains/URLs and websites that we run on third party social networks such as Facebook (e.g. Facebook fan page).

Nestlé mobile sites/applications

This refers to any consumer-directed mobile sites or applications operated by Nestlé, including our smartphone apps (e.g., iPhone apps).

Nestlé electronic messaging programs

This refers to any consumer-directed electronic messaging programs operated by Nestlé including e-mail, text and other electronic messages. These programs might be advertised on one of our websites or applications or in a print ad.

Offline registration cards

This refers to printed registration and similar cards that we may collect from consumers via, for example, postal mail, in-store demos, contests and other promotions or other offline events.

This refers to personal information that we may collect from consumers through our call centres, for example if you call us with a question or comment or to sign up for marketing communications over the phone.

Advertising interactions.

Interactions with our advertisements (e.g., if you interact with on one of our ads on a third party website, we may receive information about that interaction).

In the course of our interactions with you, we may create Personal Data about you (e.g. records of your purchases from our websites).

Data from other sources

This refers to personal information we may obtain about you from other sources. For example, we may hire a third party data aggregator to provide us additional information about our existing consumers (this is known as “data appending”). We may also receive information from third party co-sponsors who we may occasionally partner with to run special contests or other promotions. We may also receive information about consumers when we acquire other companies, from public sources, from third party social networks and through market research (if feedback is not provided on an anonymous basis).

We may automatically collect data from Nestlé commercial coffee machines that are leased to enterprises. This information may include the machine Serial Number, machine alerts or errors, ingredient stock levels, and the number and type of coffees prepared by users, with the respective date and time. This information is associated with the enterprise customer but is not linked to any individual user of the machine. We use this information to determine usage trends and stock levels.

2. What information do we collect?

Depending on how you interact with us (online, offline, over the phone, etc.), we may collect from you various types of information (personal and aggregate), as described in this section.

Personal information (as used in this Privacy Notice) refers to such types of information that can be used to personally identify you, whether alone or in combination with other available information, whereas aggregate information does not allow for such identification.

In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine/link one type of information with another type of information (e.g., personal contact information with account login and/or demographic information) and store them together in our records. In cases, where personal and aggregate information are combined, such information will always be considered as personal information. We strive to limit the amount of personal information we collect and store to that which is reasonably necessary to provide you the relevant services. We generally store your personal information for as long as your account is active with us or as needed to provide you the relevant services. We may store your personal information for a longer period of time to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for records management purposes.

Personal contact information

This includes any information that would allow us to personally contact you, such as your name, home or mailing address, phone number (home, cell, etc.), or email address. In some cases, this could include personal information that you give us about someone else (for example, if you provide a friend’s email address for a tell-a-friend program). We typically collect personal contact information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up, website and social community features, online purchases, consumer service inquiries, contests and other promotions, and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, your personal contact information may be stored under your account profile.

Account login information

This refers to any information that is required for you to establish a unique account with us or for us to give you access to your specific account profile. Examples may include your login ID/email address, screen name, password, and/or security question and answer. We only collect unique login information for those activities that require an account, such as general website registration, newsletter sign-up, and website and social community features. Your login information, especially your password, should be kept confidential and never shared with anyone else.

It may include information about your children’s genders, feeding styles, birthdates, or expected due dates. It may include information about work status or professional credentials. It may also include information about your pets and pet preferences. We may collect demographic information in connection with a variety of activities, including general website registration, newsletter sign-up, website and social community registration, contests and other promotions, and consumer surveys. If you create an account with us, you may be allowed to modify certain demographic information stored under your account. To do so, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if available) or contact Consumer Services.

We use this information to better understand your needs and preferences, personalize our interactions with you, and send business communications to you in order to keep you informed about the latest information about our products that may be of interest to you and/or your patients.

Technical computer information

This includes any information about the computer system or other technological device that you may be using to access one of our websites or applications. We typically collect this information through automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons. Examples of technical computer information may include your computer’s IP address, operating system type, and web browser type. If you access a Nestlé website or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected information may also include your phone’s unique device ID, geo-location and other similar mobile device data.

Website usage information

This includes information about how you use and navigate our websites and applications, including which links you click on, which pages or content you view and for how long, and other similar information and statistics about your interactions with a Nestlé website or application (e.g., date and time of visit, which site you came from, favourite recipes and site activities, high game scores, etc.). This information is captured using automated tracking technologies such as browser cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons, and may also be collected through the use of third party tracking services (such as Google Analytics) that collect data in aggregate (such as number of visits to a particular page, or the amount of time spent on a web site). We may also use these technologies, such as web beacons, to capture information about how users respond to certain email campaigns (e.g., time the email is opened, where user links to from the email, etc.). Please see Question 8 (“Tracking technologies – How and why do we use them?”).

Please note that “flash” cookies are different from "browser” cookies because of the way in which flash cookies capture and store data. Your browser’s cookie management tools will not remove flash cookies.

We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. We use tracking tools to serve you with interest-based advertising and to better understand your behaviours and browsing activities. We might permit third parties to gather information passively on our websites, including for behavioral advertising purposes. We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. You can control tracking tools. In particular, your browser gives you the ability to delete or reject browser cookies. If you block cookies, certain features on our website may not work. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so note that our systems may not recognize Do Not Track headers or signals from some or all browsers. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this Privacy Notice will stop.

This includes information that you voluntarily share with us about your experience in using our products and services, including our websites and applications. Examples may include unsolicited comments and suggestions, testimonials, or other questions or feedback related to our products. We typically collect this information in the form of consumer surveys, consumer panels, contact forms, “Ask the Expert” forms, and email correspondence.

Consumer-generated content

This refers to any content that you create and then share with us (and perhaps others) by uploading it to one of our websites or applications, including one of our Facebook sites. Examples may include photos, videos, personal stories, or other similar media or content. We may collect and publish consumer-generated content in connection with a variety of activities, including contests and other promotions, website community features, consumer engagement, and third party social networking.

Social network information

This refers to any information that you share publicly on a third-party social network or is part of your profile on a third party social network (such as Facebook) and that you allow the third party social network to share with us. Examples include your basic account information (e.g. name, email address, gender, birthday, current city, profile picture, user ID, list of friends, etc.) and any other additional information or activities that you permit the third party social network to share with third party application developers. For example, we may receive your social network profile information (or parts of it) every time you download or interact with a Nestlé web application on a social network such as Facebook or every time you use a social networking feature that is integrated within a Nestlé website (such as Facebook Connect). To learn more about how your information from a third party social network may be obtained by us (or other third party application developers), please visit the website of the relevant social network. You further acknowledge that we may use your personal information to match information with a social network for advertising purposes (see “Marketing communications” under Question 3 of this Privacy Notice).

This includes any information that you use to make a purchase, such as your credit card details (cardholder name, card number, expiration date, etc.) or other forms of payment (if such are made available). This also includes the billing name and address associated with your form of payment. If you create an account with us when making a purchase, your payment information may be stored under your account profile. To review or edit this information, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if one is available) or contact the consumer service department listed at the relevant store website.

Other information (depending on context)

This refers to any other information that we might need to collect for a specific Nestlé form, feature, or other service that you use or request. What this information includes will vary depending on the method of collection and the specific purpose(s) for which the information is being collected. Please see Question 3 (“How do we use your information?”) for more specific examples.

3. How do we use your personal information?

The following paragraphs describe the various purposes and features for which we might collect and use your personal information, and the different types of information that might be collected from you through the different methods described in Question 1 above. Please note that not all of the uses below will be relevant to every consumer.

We may use your personal information to maintain your accounts with us, including administering any consumer loyalty, rewards or membership programs that are associated with your account. This typically involves the use of personal information that was originally collected to set up your account (e.g., personal contact information, payment information, account login information, demographic information, etc.).

We may collect and use your personal information to provide you consumer service, including responses to your inquiries. This typically requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information (such as your name or email address) and information regarding the reason for your inquiry (e.g., order status, technical issue, product question/complaint, general question, etc.). Consumer service may be provided through various forms of communication, including email correspondence, call centre support, social communities and live online chat features.

Product improvement and customization

We may collect and use your personal information so we can constantly improve our products, tailor them to your needs, and come up with new product ideas. This mostly involves the collection and use of demographic information and consumer feedback.

We may collect and use your personal information to get you more actively engaged with our products and services (including our websites and applications), thereby increasing overall brand engagement and awareness. This mostly involves the collection, use, and publication of consumer-generated content, profile information, promotional activity, engagement with our websites & digital content.

Contests and other promotions

We may collect and use your personal information to administer a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. These events typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (for prize fulfilment), demographic information (for eligibility determination), and, in some instances, consumer-generated content. Some of our promotions may be run on third party social networks such as Facebook (for example, on our Facebook fan pages). To comply with legal requirements, we may publish or share a limited amount of personal information (such as name and city of residence) about the winners of a particular promotion. For more information about our contests and other promotions, please see the official rules or details posted with each promotion.

Marketing communications

We may collect and use your personal information to send you marketing communications, such as email communications, SMS text messages, and postal mailings. Please note that if you choose to receive SMS text messages, your mobile service provider’s fees for messaging will apply. We may also show you marketing communications on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member, by matching activities or information collected on our websites with those collected on third party sites (“Targeted Advertising”). These marketing communications will keep you up-to-date on the latest news, events, special offers, and promotions from our brands of interest to you. On occasion, these communications may also introduce you to other Nestlé brands and inform you about offers and promotions from other third party companies. Sending you marketing communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and demographic information. In some instances (such as for mobile apps and text messaging programs), this could involve the use of your precise geo-location, which may allow us to send you location-based offers and promotions. You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email communications or text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication. If you have an account with us, you may be given the option to change your communication preferences under the relevant edit-account section of our site (if available) or by contactingConsumer Services. Changing these preferences would also remove you from our lists for future Targeted Advertising. You may also visit social media sites where you are a member to explore opt out options they may provide for Targeted Advertising. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive administrative communications from us, such as order confirmations, notifications about your account activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important announcements. You will also still see generic ads on other websites, including on social media sites where you are a member.

Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third party company, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third party (not Nestlé) to opt-out from such communications. This process may be outlined in the third party’s privacy policy.

Third party social networking

We may collect and use your personal information when you interact with third party social networking features such as “Facebook Connect” or “Facebook Like”. These features may be integrated in our sites or applications for the purposes of running contests, allowing you to share content with friends, or other stated purposes. If you use these features, we may have the ability to obtain certain information about you from your social networking profile (see “Social network information” under Question 2 of this Privacy Notice). You can learn more about how these features work, and the profile data we may obtain about you, by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network.

Website improvement and personalization

We may collect and use your information to improve and personalize your experience on our websites and applications, to analyze your preferences and habits, to anticipate your needs based on our analysis of your profile, to improve and personalize your experience on our websites and apps, to ensure that content from our website/apps is optimized for you and for your computer or device and to participate in interactive features. This is typically done through automated tracking technologies (please also see Question 8) that collect and remember certain account login information, technical information, and/or previous website usage information. For example, we might remember your login ID/email address or screen name so you can quickly login the next time you visit our site or so you can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping cart. Based on this type of information, we may also show you specific Nestlé content or promotions that are tailored to your interests.

Website community features

We may collect and use your personal information to give you access to website community features, including features that may allow you to upload and share recipes, pictures, videos, artwork, or other messages or content. This typically involves the collection, use, and (in some instances) public display of certain personal contact information, account login information, demographic information, and/or consumer-generated content. Because these features are “communal” in nature, information or content that you post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use caution when using these features or uploading content to a Nestlé site. For some community features, we may give you the ability to control whether some parts of your profile can be seen by others. To access these settings, log in to the relevant edit account section of our site (if one is available) and access your community profile. For website community features that have social networking integration (such as “Facebook Connect”), see separate paragraph on “Third party social networking”.

Website viral features (e.g. tell-a-friend)

We may request and use your personal information so you can use website viral features, such as our tell-a-friend features. These features allow you to easily share certain news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (such as names and email addresses) so that the selected one-time message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In most cases, we do not retain the information provided. In some cases (for example, as part of a refer-a-friend program), we may store the information so we can track and reward consumers for their successful referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features administered by third party social networks (such as Facebook’s “Share” and “Like” features), please refer to the website of the relevant social network for additional information.

We may collect and use your personal information to process and ship your orders, to inform you about the status of your orders, correct addresses and conduct identity verification and other fraud-detection activities. This could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or other information related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the on-going storage of your payment information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases.

Please note that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases on those sites.

Other general purposes (e.g., website security, internal research)

We may collect and use your information for other general business purposes, such as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of our websites and applications, to conduct internal marketing and demographic studies (including using anonymized personal information in a statistical or aggregated form for research and marketing purposes) and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These activities mostly require the collection and use of certain demographic information, technical computer information, website usage information, and consumer feedback.

We collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for the purposes of assessing and ensuring the credit worthiness of suppliers and customers and for the purpose of determining the continuing viability of such suppliers and customers when entering into or renewing contracts for supply of products to and from such suppliers or customers.

4. How do we protect your personal information?

We use a variety of standard methods (described below) to help keep consumer information confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply to information you choose to share in public areas such as our website and social community features or other social areas.

Secure operating environments

We store your information in secure operating environments that are protected from the public and that we only allow authorized Nestlé employees and agents/contractors to access on a need-to-know basis. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information; however, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Also, as part of our standard procedures, your personal information may be stored and processed in jurisdictions outside of your province of residence or outside the country such as the United State and Switzerland. In such cases, we continue to use generally accepted industry standards and secure operating environments to protect your information. However, regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions may be able to gain access to your information pursuant to the laws of those jurisdictions.

Encryption for payment info

We use industry-standard encryption to provide greater protection for sensitive financial information, such as credit card information, sent to us over the web. For example, encryption is used when you make payments through our online stores. Please note, however, that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. Because these sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases.

Prior authentication for account access

We require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g., login ID/email address, password) before they can access or make changes to their account information. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account.

Measures we expect you to take

It is important for you to also play a role in keeping your information safe and secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account password that is hard for others to guess and never reveal your password to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email address or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer. You should also make use of any privacy settings or controls we may provide you in our website community areas.

5. What happens if you refuse to provide your personal information?

If you choose not to submit any personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities and personalized features and you may limit the services and special offers we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you will not be able to receive any of our newsletters or otherwise register on our websites or use our applications. If you refuse to provide your credit card number, you will not be able to purchase products at a Nestlé online store. However, to simply browse our websites and learn more about our products, you do not need to give us any personal information.

6. Who do we disclose your personal information to and why?

Nestlé will not share your personal information with any third party that intends to use it for direct marketing purposes unless we have specifically informed you and you have given us specific permission to do this. Employees of Nestlé may have access to your personal information in the course of providing our services to you. Employee access to personal information will be restricted to those employees who have a legitimate need to know such information for the performance of their employment duties at Nestlé.

We may share your personal information with our subsidiary companies, companies in which Nestlé S.A. has control through either direct or indirect ownership (collectively “Nestlé Group”). Nestlé may also share your personal information with third parties, but only in the following circumstances:

Service Providers, Agents and Contractors

We may use third parties, like service providers, agents or contractors to provide support for the internal operations of our websites and applications and to assist us with administering our websites and applications or the various functions, programs and promotions available to you. Some of these third parties may be located outside the country where you accessed this website. These third parties and its employees may come into contact with your personal information in the course of providing their services to us. Any such third party must at all times provide the same levels of security for your personal information as Nestlé and, where required, are bound by a legal agreement to keep your personal information private, secure and to process it only on the specific instructions of Nestlé. We are part of the Nestlé global company. The server that makes this web site available is located outside the country from which you have accessed this web site. Our main hosting provider for most Nestlé Web sites is based in the United States. This provider is bound by a contract that ensures a high standard of privacy protection and requires (amongst other provisions) that it act only on Nestlé instructions and implements all technical measures necessary on an ongoing basis to keep your personal information secure.

Credit reporting agencies/debt collectors.To the extent permitted by applicable law, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors are external companies that we use to help us to verify your creditworthiness (in particular for orders with invoice) or to collect outstanding invoices.

Credit reporting agencies/debt collectors.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors are external companies that we use to help us to verify your creditworthiness (in particular for orders with invoice) or to collect outstanding invoices.

Partners and Joint Promotions

From time to time, we may run a joint or co-sponsored program or promotion on our website or application with another company, organization, or other reputable third party; and, as part of this event, collect and process personal information. If your personal information is being collected by (or is shared with) a company other than Nestlé as part of such promotion, we will let you know this at the time your personal information is collected. Periodically, we may run a promotion on our website or application that features the products or services of another company and will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive information directly from that third party company. When doing any promotion involving another company, we may provide a separate link to that company's privacy policy and we encourage you to read it before you share any personal information, as we cannot guarantee they adhere to the same privacy practices. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a company other than ours, you can always choose not to opt in or participate in these events at the time the personal information is collected/requested.

Legal and Business Transfers

We may also disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes, to respond to any claims, enforce the terms of any agreement or the terms of our website, or to protect the safety, property, privacy or rights of Nestlé, its customers, or the public.

In the event of a merger or acquisition of all or part of Nestlé by another company, or in the event that Nestlé were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the Nestlé business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by that Nestlé business, which could include personal information. Similarly, personal information may be transferred as part of a corporate reorganization, insolvency proceeding, or other similar event, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.

Health Care Practitioner

When you register for an account on one of our websites based upon receiving an invitation to register from your practitioner, we will share your information, including your Genetic Data file, with your practitioner for the purposes of allowing them to make medical recommendations to you based on your Genetic Data.

Aggregate Information

We may share aggregated demographic or survey information with third parties, but this information is in anonymous form and does not contain any personal information. The aggregate information that we share may include anonymous information that is captured through the use of cookies and other similar tracking technology, as explained in the Question 8 below.

7. How can you access, modify, or make other choices regarding the use of your personal information?

The following outlines the choices you have with respect to the collection and use of your personal information by us.

1. You always have the option not to share any of your personal information with us. However, if you choose this option, you will be limited in the activities and features we can provide you, as mentioned in Question 5 above.

2. If you do not want to receive newsletters, announcements, or other communications and/or services from a Nestlé website or brand, please do not opt-in for those communications or services at the time of registration. If you have opted-in and, at a later time, wish to opt-out, please visit the appropriate "your account" or “your profile” section(s) on our website or application and amend your preferences.

3. Along with every e-mail marketing communication sent to you, we provide you the opportunity to discontinue receiving future marketing communications (i.e., unsubscribe). Simply follow the unsubscribe process or directions provided in the email. Please read our Marketing communications section for limitations on certain administrative communications, order confirmations, and account notifications.

4. Subject to our right to retain certain information (see Question 10) You can always review, update or withdraw consent to Nestlé’s processing of any personal information that we may have collected about you including for our general website and application registration. To do this, please visit the appropriate "your account" or “your profile” section(s) on our website or application (if available).

If any of the mechanisms set forth above is not available or you wish to make a different request such as accessing your information, pleaseContact Us. We will respond to all access requests within 30 days or we will notify you when more time is needed to respond.

In addition, if you participated in a promotion or program that involved a third party and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third party directly to opt-out from such communications. This process may be outlined in the third party’s privacy policy.

8. Tracking Technology – How and why do we use them?

Nestlé does make use of tracking technologies (“Cookies”, “IP Addresses”, Log Files”, “Web Beacons”) to gather certain information such as browser type and operating system, referring page, path through site, domain of ISP etc. for the purpose of improving the use and functionality of our websites and other purposes described below. Tracking technologies help us tailor our websites to your personal needs.

We use Cookies to improve the use and functionality of our websites and to better understand how visitors use our websites and the tools and services offered on it and to communicate elsewhere on the web. The storage of Cookies on your computer provides an easy and convenient way for us to personalize or enhance your experience on our websites and to make your next visit more enjoyable. Nestlé makes use of third party cookies which are set by third parties for different services (for example, website analytics or advertising).

If you would like to learn more about Nestlé’s policy on Cookies and your rights, please visit theNestlé Cookies Policy.

We may keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to (among other things): (i) troubleshoot technical concerns, (ii) maintain website safety and security, (iii) restrict access to our websites to certain users, and, (iv) better understand how our websites are utilized. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

We (or a third party on our behalf) may collect information in the form of logs files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help us gather (among other things) (i) a user’s browser type and operating system, (ii) information about a user’s session (such as the URL they came from, the date and time they visited our website, and which pages they've viewed on our website and for how long), and, (iii) other similar navigational or click-stream data. We also use information captured in log files for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve and customize the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user.

We may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our websites or include them in the e-mail messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as “web bugs”) are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data back to us. The information collected via web beacons may include some of the information described in the IP Address section directly above, as well as information about how a user responds to an email campaign (e.g., the time the email is opened, where does the user link to from the email, etc.). We use web beacon information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization.

9. E Marketing - What is spamming and what is our position on spam e-mails?

Spamming is where unsolicited e-mails are sent to you containing advertisements or marketing related materials without your consent.

We do NOT send spam e-mails. Sending e-mails without consent is illegal in Canada. We will not use your personal information (including your e-mail address) for direct e-mail marketing or follow-up communications unless you give us your express opt-in permission or unless we are otherwise permitted to do so under the law.

Also, we do not share your personal information with any third party who will use your personal information for illegal spam mails.

Nestlé websites give you the opportunity to receive marketing information by e-mail. Every marketing e-mail sent by Nestlé will give you the opportunity at any time to stop receiving such e-mails.

If for some reason you believe you have received spam e-mail from a Nestlé Group company pleaseContact Usimmediately.

10. How long do we keep your personal information?

We may store the personal information that you have provided us with through the various methods described in this Privacy Notice in our databases such as our Consumer Relationship Marketing database. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is reasonably necessary taking into consideration our need to answer queries or resolve problems, provide improved and new services, respond to any claims, enforce the terms of any agreement or the terms of our website and comply with legal requirements under applicable law(s). This means that we may retain your personal information for a reasonable period after you stop using Nestlé services or stop using our websites or applications. After this period, your personal information will be deleted from all systems in the Nestlé Group.

We remind you that you have a right to have your personal information deleted as further set out in Question 7 above.

11. Do we collect personal information from children?

We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children below the age of 13. If we discover that we’ve accidentally collected information from a child below 13, we will remove that child’s information from our records as soon as feasibly possible. However, we may collect personal information about children below the age of 13 from the parent or custodian directly and therefore with their explicit consent.

12. Do we link to other third party sites?

Our websites and applications may provide links to, or features from, other third party sites (such as independent e-commerce sites and third party social networks). If you link to or use such third party sites or features, you do so at your own risk. We do not control and are not responsible for the content or practices of any third party site, application, or feature.

13. Other important information
